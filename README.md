## About This Project

This project is a modern, single-page website that serves as a professional hub for all of my public-facing content. It aggregates articles from LinkedIn and other sources into a clean, readable format. The design is clean, professional, and fully responsive, with a focus on a great user experience.

The core philosophy of this site is to be a "digital notebook"‚Äîa place to share insights, document learning, and explore the cutting edge of technology, particularly in AI and full-stack development.

## Key Features

* **‚ú® Modern UI/UX:** The site features subtle animations, a "glassmorphism" header, and a clean, high-contrast design for excellent readability.
* **üåó Dark & Light Mode:** A theme toggle allows users to switch between light and dark modes based on their preference, which is saved in their browser.
* **üì± Fully Responsive:** Fully optimized for a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **üîç Dynamic Article Filtering:** Users can filter the displayed articles by category for easy content discovery.
* **üöÄ Pure Vanilla Stack:** Built with fundamental web technologies‚Äîno frameworks needed‚Äîmaking it lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.

## Built With

This website is built entirely with client-side technologies, making it perfect for static hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages.
